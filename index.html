<span><p>Active learning has emerged as a standard paradigm in areas with scarcity of
labeled training data, such as in the medical domain. Language models have
emerged as the prevalent choice of several natural language tasks due to the
performance boost offered by these models. However, in several domains, such as
medicine, the scarcity of labeled training data is a common issue. Also, these
models may not work well in cases where class imbalance is prevalent. Active
learning may prove helpful in these cases to boost the performance with a
limited label budget. To this end, we propose a novel method using sampling
techniques based on submodular optimization and optimal transport for active
learning in language models, dubbed ALLWAS. We construct a sampling strategy
based on submodular optimization of the designed objective in the gradient
domain. Furthermore, to enable learning from few samples, we propose a novel
strategy for sampling from the Wasserstein barycenters. Our empirical
evaluations on standard benchmark datasets for text classification show that
our methods perform significantly better (&gt;20% relative increase in some cases)
than existing approaches for active learning on language models.

<span><p>Large-scale conversational assistants like Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google
Assistant process every utterance using multiple models for domain, intent and
named entity recognition. Given the decoupled nature of model development and
large traffic volumes, it is extremely difficult to identify utterances
processed erroneously by such systems. We address this challenge to detect
domain classification errors using offline Transformer models. We combine
utterance encodings from a RoBERTa model with the Nbest hypothesis produced by
the production system. We then fine-tune end-to-end in a multitask setting
using a small dataset of humanannotated utterances with domain classification
errors. We tested our approach for detecting misclassifications from one domain
that accounts for &lt;0.5% of the traffic in a large-scale conversational AI
system. Our approach achieves an F1 score of 30% outperforming a bi- LSTM
baseline by 16.9% and a standalone RoBERTa model by 4.8%. We improve this
further by 2.2% to 32.2% by ensembling multiple models.

<span><p>Current work in named entity recognition (NER) shows that data augmentation
techniques can produce more robust models. However, most existing techniques
focus on augmenting in-domain data in low-resource scenarios where annotated
data is quite limited. In contrast, we study cross-domain data augmentation for
the NER task. We investigate the possibility of leveraging data from
high-resource domains by projecting it into the low-resource domains.
Specifically, we propose a novel neural architecture to transform the data
representation from a high-resource to a low-resource domain by learning the
patterns (e.g. style, noise, abbreviations, etc.) in the text that
differentiate them and a shared feature space where both domains are aligned.
We experiment with diverse datasets and show that transforming the data to the
low-resource domain representation achieves significant improvements over only
using data from high-resource domains.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01815">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>How data is represented and operationalized is critical for building
computational solutions that are both effective and efficient. A common
approach is to represent data objects as binary vectors, denoted \textit{hash
codes}, which require little storage and enable efficient similarity search
through direct indexing into a hash table or through similarity computations in
an appropriate space. Due to the limited expressibility of hash codes, compared
to real-valued representations, a core open challenge is how to generate hash
codes that well capture semantic content or latent properties using a small
number of bits, while ensuring that the hash codes are distributed in a way
that does not reduce their search efficiency. State of the art methods use
representation learning for generating such hash codes, focusing on neural
autoencoder architectures where semantics are encoded into the hash codes by
learning to reconstruct the original inputs of the hash codes. This thesis
addresses the above challenge and makes a number of contributions to
representation learning that (i) improve effectiveness of hash codes through
more expressive representations and a more effective similarity measure than
the current state of the art, namely the Hamming distance, and (ii) improve
efficiency of hash codes by learning representations that are especially suited
to the choice of search method. The contributions are empirically validated on
several tasks related to similarity search and recommendation.

<span><p>Masked language modeling (MLM), a self-supervised pretraining objective, is
widely used in natural language processing for learning text representations.
MLM trains a model to predict a random sample of input tokens that have been
replaced by a [MASK] placeholder in a multi-class setting over the entire
vocabulary. When pretraining, it is common to use alongside MLM other auxiliary
objectives on the token or sequence level to improve downstream performance
(e.g. next sentence prediction). However, no previous work so far has attempted
in examining whether other simpler linguistically intuitive or not objectives
can be used standalone as main pretraining objectives. In this paper, we
explore five simple pretraining objectives based on token-level classification
tasks as replacements of MLM. Empirical results on GLUE and SQuAD show that our
proposed methods achieve comparable or better performance to MLM using a
BERT-BASE architecture. We further validate our methods using smaller models,
showing that pretraining a model with 41% of the BERT-BASE's parameters,
BERT-MEDIUM results in only a 1% drop in GLUE scores with our best objective.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As a kind of new expression elements, Internet memes are popular and
extensively used in online chatting scenarios since they manage to make
dialogues vivid, moving, and interesting. However, most current dialogue
researches focus on text-only dialogue tasks. In this paper, we propose a new
task named as \textbf{M}eme incorporated \textbf{O}pen-domain \textbf{D}ialogue
(MOD). Compared to previous dialogue tasks, MOD is much more challenging since
it requires the model to understand the multimodal elements as well as the
emotions behind them. To facilitate the MOD research, we construct a
large-scale open-domain multimodal dialogue dataset incorporating abundant
Internet memes into utterances. The dataset consists of $\sim$45K Chinese
conversations with $\sim$606K utterances. Each conversation contains about $13$
utterances with about $4$ Internet memes on average and each utterance equipped
with an Internet meme is annotated with the corresponding emotion. In addition,
we present a simple and effective method, which utilizes a unified generation
network to solve the MOD task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
trained on the proposed corpus is able to achieve expressive communication
including texts and memes. The corpus and models have been publicly available

<span><p>As the digital news industry becomes the main channel of information
dissemination, the adverse impact of fake news is explosively magnified. The
credibility of a news report should not be considered in isolation. Rather,
previously published news articles on the similar event could be used to assess
the credibility of a news report. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT-based
multimodal unreliable news detection framework, which captures both textual and
visual information from unreliable articles utilising the contrastive learning
strategy. The contrastive learner interacts with the unreliable news classifier
to push similar credible news (or similar unreliable news) closer while moving
news articles with similar content but opposite credibility labels away from

linguistic markers, ignoring the overall language structure and dialogue
context. To address this issue, we propose to use a neural network model to
perform the similarity measure for entrainment. Our model is context-aware, and
it further leverages a novel component to learn the shared high-level

<span><p>Vision-and-language (V\&amp;L) reasoning necessitates perception of visual
concepts such as objects and actions, understanding semantics and language

crucial aspect of visual reasoning is spatial understanding, which involves
understanding relative locations of objects, i.e.\ implicitly learning the
geometry of the scene. In this work, we evaluate the faithfulness of V\&amp;L
models to such geometric understanding, by formulating the prediction of
pair-wise relative locations of objects as a classification as well as a
regression task. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art transformer-based

we design two objectives as proxies for 3D spatial reasoning (SR) -- object

improvements in accuracy for the "GQA" visual question answering challenge (in

<span><p>The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is
of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering
(QA), the current state-of-the-art pre-trained models typically need
fine-tuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their
performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (&lt; 100 examples). To
address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning framework that leverages
pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly aligned with their pre-training
framework. Specifically, we construct the input as a concatenation of the
question, a mask token representing the answer span and a context. Given this
input, the model is fine-tuned using the same objective as that of its
pre-training objective. Through experimental studies on various few-shot
configurations, we show that this formulation leads to significant gains on
multiple QA benchmarks (an absolute gain of 34.2 F1 points on average when
there are only 16 training examples). The gains extend further when used with
larger models (Eg:- 72.3 F1 on SQuAD using BART-large with only 32 examples)

benchmark, our model outperforms the XLM-Roberta-large by an absolute margin of

<span><p>Learning hierarchical structures in sequential data -- from simple
algorithmic patterns to natural language -- in a reliable, generalizable way
remains a challenging problem for neural language models. Past work has shown
that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to generalize on held-out
algorithmic or syntactic patterns without supervision or some inductive bias.
To remedy this, many papers have explored augmenting RNNs with various
differentiable stacks, by analogy with finite automata and pushdown automata.
In this paper, we present a stack RNN model based on the recently proposed
Nondeterministic Stack RNN (NS-RNN) that achieves lower cross-entropy than all
previous stack RNNs on five context-free language modeling tasks (within 0.05
nats of the information-theoretic lower bound), including a task in which the
NS-RNN previously failed to outperform a deterministic stack RNN baseline. Our
model assigns arbitrary positive weights instead of probabilities to stack
actions, and we provide an analysis of why this improves training. We also

<span><p>Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language
pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at
random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text.
In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting.
First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is
sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation,
leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of
alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address
these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned
representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking
strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three
downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our
pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a

possible to teach it to execute a mathematical task that has previously proved
difficult for Transformers - longhand modulo operations - with a relatively
small number of examples. Specifically, we fine-tune GPT-Neo to solve the

This is achieved by constructing an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning, with

helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of
previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse

coherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability
to handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence

Accordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based

<span><p>Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have
been proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in
natural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important
optimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the
original input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited,
from the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In
this paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of
the problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it.
We establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem

than the previous bound which only holds in special case. Extensive experiments
involving five NLP tasks, six datasets and eleven NLP models show that LS can
largely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to

Supervised Learning (SL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), issues still exist.
Firstly, previous methods do not provide explicit and effective guidance for
Questioner to generate visually related and informative questions. Secondly,
the effect of RL is hampered by an incompetent component, i.e., the Guesser,
who makes image predictions based on the generated dialogs and assigns rewards
accordingly. To enhance VD Questioner: 1) we propose a Related entity enhanced

exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS),
at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a
prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are
further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention
span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore,
in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on

<span><p>In this paper, we explore the effects of language variants, data sizes, and
fine-tuning task types in Arabic pre-trained language models. To do so, we
build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a
fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also
examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models
that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our
different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models
by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest
that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more
important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining
an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks.

<span><p>The rise of social media has led to the increasing of comments on online
forums. However, there still exists invalid comments which are not informative
for users. Moreover, those comments are also quite toxic and harmful to people.
In this paper, we create a dataset for constructive and toxic speech detection,
named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset)
with 10,000 human-annotated comments. For these tasks, we propose a system for
constructive and toxic speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer
learning model in Vietnamese NLP as PhoBERT. With this system, we obtain
F1-scores of 78.59% and 59.40% for classifying constructive and toxic comments,
respectively. Besides, we implement various baseline models as traditional
Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based models to evaluate the dataset.
With the results, we can solve several tasks on the online discussions and
develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity of
Vietnamese social media comments automatically.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The primary paradigm for multi-task training in natural language processing
is to represent the input with a shared pre-trained language model, and add a
small, thin network (head) per task. Given an input, a target head is the head
that is selected for outputting the final prediction. In this work, we examine
the behaviour of non-target heads, that is, the output of heads when given
input that belongs to a different task than the one they were trained for. We
find that non-target heads exhibit emergent behaviour, which may either explain
the target task, or generalize beyond their original task. For example, in a
numerical reasoning task, a span extraction head extracts from the input the
arguments to a computation that results in a number generated by a target
generative head. In addition, a summarization head that is trained with a
target question answering head, outputs query-based summaries when given a
question and a context from which the answer is to be extracted. This emergent
behaviour suggests that multi-task training leads to non-trivial extrapolation
of skills, which can be harnessed for interpretability and generalization.

Near-perfect supervised methods have been developed for use in resource-rich

<span><p>Product quantization (PQ) is a widely used technique for ad-hoc retrieval.
Recent studies propose supervised PQ, where the embedding and quantization
models can be jointly trained with supervised learning. However, there is a
lack of appropriate formulation of the joint training objective; thus, the
improvements over previous non-supervised baselines are limited in reality. In
this work, we propose the Matching-oriented Product Quantization (MoPQ), where
a novel objective Multinoulli Contrastive Loss (MCL) is formulated. With the
minimization of MCL, we are able to maximize the matching probability of query

Given that the exact computation of MCL is intractable due to the demand of
vast contrastive samples, we further propose the Differentiable Cross-device
Sampling (DCS), which significantly augments the contrastive samples for
precise approximation of MCL. We conduct extensive experimental studies on four
real-world datasets, whose results verify the effectiveness of MoPQ.

<span><p>Humans (e.g., crowdworkers) have a remarkable ability in solving different
tasks, by simply reading textual instructions that define them and looking at a

struggle with generalization across tasks (e.g., a question-answering system
cannot solve classification tasks). A long-standing challenge in AI is to build
a model that is equipped with the understanding of human-readable instructions
that define the tasks, and can generalize to new tasks. To study this, we
introduce NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a dataset of 61 distinct tasks, their
human-authored instructions and 193k task instances. The instructions are
obtained from crowdsourcing instructions used to collect existing NLP datasets

Our results indicate that models can benefit from instructions to generalize

automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i) the
plant species from which active molecules are extracted, (ii) the
microorganisms species for which active molecules can act against, and (iii)
the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against these
microorganisms. The parameters are extracted without part-of-speech tagging

text annotation), and the models training is performed with unsupervised

<span><p>We study the problem of query attribute value extraction, which aims to
identify named entities from user queries as diverse surface form attribute
values and afterward transform them into formally canonical forms. Such a
problem consists of two phases: {named entity recognition (NER)} and {attribute
value normalization (AVN)}. However, existing works only focus on the NER phase
but neglect equally important AVN. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a
unified query attribute value extraction system in e-commerce search named
QUEACO, which involves both two phases. Moreover, by leveraging large-scale
weakly-labeled behavior data, we further improve the extraction performance
with less supervision cost. Specifically, for the NER phase, QUEACO adopts a
novel teacher-student network, where a teacher network that is trained on the
strongly-labeled data generates pseudo-labels to refine the weakly-labeled data
for training a student network. Meanwhile, the teacher network can be
dynamically adapted by the feedback of the student's performance on
strongly-labeled data to maximally denoise the noisy supervisions from the weak
labels. For the AVN phase, we also leverage the weakly-labeled
query-to-attribute behavior data to normalize surface form attribute values
from queries into canonical forms from products. Extensive experiments on a
real-world large-scale E-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
QUEACO.

<span><p>Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations
between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated
artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them
much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,

not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is
important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose
methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables.
Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently

parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation
