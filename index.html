<summary class="article-expander__title">Want To Reduce Labeling Cost? GPT-3 Can Help. (arXiv:2108.13487v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13487">

<span><p>Data annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process for many NLP
tasks. Although there exist various methods to produce pseudo data labels, they
are often task-specific and require a decent amount of labeled data to start
with. Recently, the immense language model GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters
has achieved tremendous improvement across many few-shot learning tasks. In
this paper, we explore ways to leverage GPT-3 as a low-cost data labeler to
train other models. We find that, to make the downstream model achieve the same
performance on a variety of NLU and NLG tasks, it costs 50% to 96% less to use
labels from GPT-3 than using labels from humans. Furthermore, we propose a
novel framework of combining pseudo labels from GPT-3 with human labels, which
leads to even better performance with limited labeling budget. These results
present a cost-effective data labeling methodology that is generalizable to
many practical applications.

<span><p>Public trust in science depends on honest and factual communication of
scientific papers. However, recent studies have demonstrated a tendency of news
media to misrepresent scientific papers by exaggerating their findings. Given
this, we present a formalization of and study into the problem of exaggeration
detection in science communication. While there are an abundance of scientific
papers and popular media articles written about them, very rarely do the
articles include a direct link to the original paper, making data collection
challenging. We address this by curating a set of labeled press
release/abstract pairs from existing expert annotated studies on exaggeration
in press releases of scientific papers suitable for benchmarking the
performance of machine learning models on the task. Using limited data from
this and previous studies on exaggeration detection in science, we introduce
MT-PET, a multi-task version of Pattern Exploiting Training (PET), which
leverages knowledge from complementary cloze-style QA tasks to improve few-shot
learning. We demonstrate that MT-PET outperforms PET and supervised learning
both when data is limited, as well as when there is an abundance of data for
the main task.

<summary class="article-expander__title">Towards Consistent Document-level Entity Linking: Joint Models for Entity Linking and Coreference Resolution. (arXiv:2108.13530v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13530">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We consider the task of document-level entity linking (EL), where it is
important to make consistent decisions for entity mentions over the full
document jointly. We aim to leverage explicit "connections" among mentions
within the document itself: we propose to join the EL task with that of
coreference resolution (coref). This is complementary to related works that
exploit either (i) implicit document information (e.g., latent relations among
entity mentions, or general language models) or (ii) connections between the
candidate links (e.g, as inferred from the external knowledge base).
Specifically, we cluster mentions that are linked via coreference, and enforce
a single EL for all of the clustered mentions together. The latter constraint
has the added benefit of increased coverage by joining EL candidate lists for
the thus clustered mentions. We formulate the coref+EL problem as a structured
prediction task over directed trees and use a globally normalized model to
solve it. Experimental results on two datasets show a boost of up to +5%
F1-score on both coref and EL tasks, compared to their standalone counterparts.
For a subset of hard cases, with individual mentions lacking the correct EL in
their candidate entity list, we obtain a +50% increase in accuracy.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13556">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As public discourse continues to move and grow online, conversations about
divisive topics on social media platforms have also increased. These divisive
topics prompt both contentious and non-contentious conversations. Although what
distinguishes these conversations, often framed as what makes these
conversations contentious, is known in broad strokes, much less is known about
the linguistic signature of these conversations. Prior work has shown that
contentious content and structure can be a predictor for this task, however,
most of them have been focused on conversation in general, very specific
events, or complex structural analysis. Additionally, many models used in prior
work have lacked interpret-ability, a key factor in online moderation. Our work
fills these gaps by focusing on conversations from highly divisive topics
(abortion, climate change, and gun control), operationalizing a set of novel
linguistic and conversational characteristics and user factors, and
incorporating them to build interpretable models. We demonstrate that such
characteristics can largely improve the performance of prediction on this task,
and also enable nuanced interpretability. Our case studies on these three
contentious topics suggest that certain generic linguistic characteristics are
highly correlated with contentiousness in conversations while others
demonstrate significant contextual influences on specific divisive topics.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13602">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most reliable methods for defending
against adversarial attacks in machine learning. Variants of this method have
been used as regularization mechanisms to achieve SOTA results on NLP
benchmarks, and they have been found to be useful for transfer learning and
continual learning. We search for the reasons for the effectiveness of AT by
contrasting vanilla and adversarially fine-tuned BERT models. We identify
partial preservation of BERT's syntactic abilities during fine-tuning as the
key to the success of AT. We observe that adversarially fine-tuned models
remain more faithful to BERT's language modeling behavior and are more
sensitive to the word order. As concrete examples of syntactic abilities, an
adversarially fine-tuned model could have an advantage of up to 38% on anaphora
agreement and up to 11% on dependency parsing. Our analysis demonstrates that
vanilla fine-tuning oversimplifies the sentence representation by focusing
heavily on one or a few label-indicative words. AT, however, moderates the
effect of these influential words and encourages representational diversity.
This allows for a more hierarchical representation of a sentence and leads to
the mitigation of BERT's loss of syntactic abilities.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently abstractive spoken language summarization raises emerging research
interest, and neural sequence-to-sequence approaches have brought significant
performance improvement. However, summarizing long meeting transcripts remains
challenging. Due to the large length of source contents and targeted summaries,
neural models are prone to be distracted on the context, and produce summaries
with degraded quality. Moreover, pre-trained language models with input length
limitations cannot be readily applied to long sequences. In this work, we first
analyze the linguistic characteristics of meeting transcripts on a
representative corpus, and find that the sentences comprising the summary

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13630">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Lip reading, aiming to recognize spoken sentences according to the given
video of lip movements without relying on the audio stream, has attracted great
interest due to its application in many scenarios. Although prior works that
explore lip reading have obtained salient achievements, they are all trained in
a non-simultaneous manner where the predictions are generated requiring access
to the full video. To breakthrough this constraint, we study the task of
simultaneous lip reading and devise SimulLR, a simultaneous lip Reading
transducer with attention-guided adaptive memory from three aspects: (1) To
address the challenge of monotonic alignments while considering the syntactic
structure of the generated sentences under simultaneous setting, we build a
transducer-based model and design several effective training strategies
including CTC pre-training, model warm-up and curriculum learning to promote
the training of the lip reading transducer. (2) To learn better spatio-temporal
representations for simultaneous encoder, we construct a truncated 3D
convolution and time-restricted self-attention layer to perform the
frame-to-frame interaction within a video segment containing fixed number of
frames. (3) The history information is always limited due to the storage in
real-time scenarios, especially for massive video data. Therefore, we devise a
novel attention-guided adaptive memory to organize semantic information of
history segments and enhance the visual representations with acceptable
computation-aware latency. The experiments show that the SimulLR achieves the
translation speedup 9.10$\times$ compared with the state-of-the-art
non-simultaneous methods, and also obtains competitive results, which indicates
the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As a prominent attribution-based explanation algorithm, Integrated Gradients
(IG) is widely adopted due to its desirable explanation axioms and the ease of

space. However, such straight-line interpolated points are not representative
of text data due to the inherent discreteness of the word embedding space. This
questions the faithfulness of the gradients computed at the interpolated points
and consequently, the quality of the generated explanations. Here we propose
Discretized Integrated Gradients (DIG), which allows effective attribution
along non-linear interpolation paths. We develop two interpolation strategies
for the discrete word embedding space that generates interpolation points that
lie close to actual words in the embedding space, yielding more faithful

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Data augmentation for cross-lingual NER requires fine-grained control over
token labels of the augmented text. Existing augmentation approach based on
masked language modeling may replace a labeled entity with words of a different
class, which makes the augmented sentence incompatible with the original label
sequence, and thus hurts the performance.We propose a data augmentation
framework with Masked-Entity Language Modeling (MELM) which effectively ensures
the replacing entities fit the original labels. Specifically, MELM linearizes
NER labels into sentence context, and thus the fine-tuned MELM is able to
predict masked tokens by explicitly conditioning on their labels. Our MELM is
agnostic to the source of data to be augmented. Specifically, when MELM is
applied to augment training data of the source language, it achieves up to 3.5%
F1 score improvement for cross-lingual NER. When unlabeled target data is
available and MELM can be further applied to augment pseudo-labeled target
data, the performance gain reaches 5.7%. Moreover, MELM consistently
outperforms multiple baseline methods for data augmentation.

Specifically, ARTime automatically captures possible operation sequences from

faithfulness is to make summarization models more extractive. In this work, we
present a framework for evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization

of papers that hinders discovery of important knowledge. In biomedicine, this
directly impacts human lives. To address this problem, we present a novel task
of extraction and search of scientific challenges and directions, to facilitate
rapid knowledge discovery. We construct and release an expert-annotated corpus
of texts sampled from full-length papers, labeled with novel semantic
categories that generalize across many types of challenges and directions. We
focus on a large corpus of interdisciplinary work relating to the COVID-19
pandemic, ranging from biomedicine to areas such as AI and economics. We apply
a model trained on our data to identify challenges and directions across the
corpus and build a dedicated search engine for this information. In studies
with researchers, including those working directly on COVID-19, we outperform a
popular scientific search engine in assisting knowledge discovery. Finally, we
show that models trained on our resource generalize to the wider biomedical
domain, highlighting its broad utility. We make our data, model and search
engine publicly available. https://challenges.apps.allenai.org

<span><p>Pretrained transformer-based models such as BERT have demonstrated
state-of-the-art predictive performance when adapted into a range of natural
language processing tasks. An open problem is how to improve the faithfulness
of explanations (rationales) for the predictions of these models. In this
paper, we hypothesize that salient information extracted a priori from the
training data can complement the task-specific information learned by the model
during fine-tuning on a downstream task. In this way, we aim to help BERT not
to forget assigning importance to informative input tokens when making
predictions by proposing SaLoss; an auxiliary loss function for guiding the
multi-head attention mechanism during training to be close to salient
information extracted a priori using TextRank. Experiments for explanation
faithfulness across five datasets, show that models trained with SaLoss
consistently provide more faithful explanations across four different feature
attribution methods compared to vanilla BERT. Using the rationales extracted
from vanilla BERT and SaLoss models to train inherently faithful classifiers,
we further show that the latter result in higher predictive performance in
downstream tasks.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13800">

<span><p>Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in
math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,
low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly
diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed
studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples
well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and
subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a
pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of
students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly
with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'
well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These
patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating
math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network
science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening
upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data
science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as
complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.
graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional
associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not
only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math
anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of
interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a
given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways
for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can
enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.

existing methods for question generation rely on large amounts of synthetically

is problematic as many niche domains rely on small text corpora, which

models to perform well by only using a biased subset of the input, without
considering the remainder features. For instance, models are able to make a
classification decision by only using the hypothesis, without learning the true
relationship between it and the premise. These structural biases lead
discriminative models to learn unintended superficial features and to
generalize poorly out of the training distribution. In this work, we
reformulate the NLI task as a generative task, where a model is conditioned on
the biased subset of the input and the label and generates the remaining subset
of the input. We show that by imposing a uniform prior, we obtain a provably
unbiased model. Through synthetic experiments, we find that this approach is
highly robust to large amounts of bias. We then demonstrate empirically on two
types of natural bias that this approach leads to fully unbiased models in

they generally perform worse than discriminative baselines. We highlight the
difficulty of the generative modeling task in the context of NLI as a cause for
this worse performance. Finally, by fine-tuning the generative model with a

However, for most tasks and domains, labeled data is seldom available and
creating it is expensive. In this work, we present a new state-of-the-art
unsupervised method based on pre-trained Transformers and Sequential Denoising
Auto-Encoder (TSDAE) which outperforms previous approaches by up to 6.4 points.
It can achieve up to 93.1% of the performance of in-domain supervised
approaches. Further, we show that TSDAE is a strong domain adaptation and
pre-training method for sentence embeddings, significantly outperforming other
approaches like Masked Language Model.
</p>
<p>A crucial shortcoming of previous studies is the narrow evaluation: Most work
mainly evaluates on the single task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), which
does not require any domain knowledge. It is unclear if these proposed methods
generalize to other domains and tasks. We fill this gap and evaluate TSDAE and
other recent approaches on four different datasets from heterogeneous domains.

<span><p>Large language models have shown promising results in zero-shot settings
(Brown et al.,2020; Radford et al., 2019). For example, they can perform
multiple choice tasks simply by conditioning on a question and selecting the
answer with the highest probability.
</p>
<p>However, ranking by string probability can be problematic due to surface form
competition-wherein different surface forms compete for probability mass, even
if they represent the same underlying concept, e.g. "computer" and "PC." Since
probability mass is finite, this lowers the probability of the correct answer,
due to competition from other strings that are valid answers (but not one of
the multiple choice options).
</p>
<p>We introduce Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information, an alternative
scoring function that directly compensates for surface form competition by
simply reweighing each option according to a term that is proportional to its a
priori likelihood within the context of the specific zero-shot task. It
achieves consistent gains in zero-shot performance over both calibrated (Zhao

<span><p>This paper presents SimCSE, a simple contrastive learning framework that
greatly advances the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. We first describe an
unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a
contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple
method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised
counterparts. We hypothesize that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation and
removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we incorporate annotated
pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning
framework, by using "entailment" pairs as positives and "contradiction" pairs
as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity
(STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT-base achieve
an average of 76.3% and 81.6% Spearman's correlation respectively, a 4.2 and
2.2 points improvement compared to previous best results. We also show -- both
theoretically and empirically -- that contrastive learning objective
regularizes pre-trained embeddings' anisotropic space to be more uniform, and
it better aligns positive pairs when supervised signals are available.

<span><p>Sarcasm is the use of words usually used to either mock or annoy someone, or
for humorous purposes. Sarcasm is largely used in social networks and
microblogging websites, where people mock or censure in a way that makes it
difficult even for humans to tell if what is said is what is meant. Failure to
identify sarcastic utterances in Natural Language Processing applications such
as sentiment analysis and opinion mining will confuse classification algorithms
and generate false results. Several studies on sarcasm detection have utilized
different learning algorithms. However, most of these learning models have
always focused on the contents of expression only, leaving the contextual
information in isolation. As a result, they failed to capture the contextual
information in the sarcastic expression. Moreover, some datasets used in
several studies have an unbalanced dataset which impacting the model result. In
this paper, we propose a contextual model for sarcasm identification in twitter
using RoBERTa, and augmenting the dataset by applying Global Vector
representation (GloVe) for the construction of word embedding and context
learning to generate more data and balancing the dataset. The effectiveness of
this technique is tested with various datasets and data augmentation settings.
In particular, we achieve performance gain by 3.2% in the iSarcasm dataset when
using data augmentation to increase 20% of data labeled as sarcastic, resulting
F-score of 40.4% compared to 37.2% without data augmentation.

answering task on COVID-19 where systems are required to return relevant
documents, snippets, and answers to a given question. Given the absence of
training data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained
with the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to
retrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the
documents and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good
quality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant
documents and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split
the snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence
classification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite the remarkable performance of large-scale generative models in
open-domain conversation, they are known to be less practical for building
real-time conversation systems due to high latency. On the other hand,
retrieval models could return responses with much lower latency but show
inferior performance to the large-scale generative models since the
conversation quality is bounded by the pre-defined response set. To take
advantage of both approaches, we propose a new training method called G2R
(Generative-to-Retrieval distillation) that preserves the efficiency of a
retrieval model while leveraging the conversational ability of a large-scale
generative model by infusing the knowledge of the generative model into the
retrieval model. G2R consists of two distinct techniques of distillation: the
data-level G2R augments the dialogue dataset with additional responses
generated by the large-scale generative model, and the model-level G2R
transfers the response quality score assessed by the generative model to the
score of the retrieval model by the knowledge distillation loss. Through
extensive experiments including human evaluation, we demonstrate that our
retrieval-based conversation system trained with G2R shows a substantially
improved performance compared to the baseline retrieval model while showing
significantly lower inference latency than the large-scale generative models.

<span><p>Scheduled sampling is widely used to mitigate the exposure bias problem for
neural machine translation. Its core motivation is to simulate the inference
scene during training by replacing ground-truth tokens with predicted tokens,
thus bridging the gap between training and inference. However, vanilla
scheduled sampling is merely based on training steps and equally treats all
decoding steps. Namely, it simulates an inference scene with uniform error
rates, which disobeys the real inference scene, where larger decoding steps
usually have higher error rates due to error accumulations. To alleviate the
above discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding
steps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of
decoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference
scene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and
inference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training
steps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our
approaches significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and vanilla
scheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches

typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type
system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver
Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus
Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features
such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and
invocation of another contract. \HELMHOLTZ{} successfully verifies several
