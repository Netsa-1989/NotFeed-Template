<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05419">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Much research has been done for debunking and analysing fake news. Many
researchers study fake news detection in the last year, but many are limited to
social media data. Currently, multiples fact-checkers are publishing their
results in various formats. Also, multiple fact-checkers use different labels
for the fake news, making it difficult to make a generalisable classifier. With
the merge classes, the performance of the machine model can be enhanced. This
domain categorisation will help group the article, which will help save the
manual effort in assigning the claim verification. In this paper, we have
presented BERT based classification model to predict the domain and
classification. We have also used additional data from fact-checked articles.
We have achieved a macro F1 score of 83.76 % for Task 3Aand 85.55 % for Task 3B
using the additional training data.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05454">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Rapid progress in natural language processing has led to its utilization in a
variety of industrial and enterprise settings, including in its use for
information extraction, specifically named entity recognition and relation
extraction, from documents such as engineering manuals and field maintenance
reports. While named entity recognition is a well-studied problem, existing
state-of-the-art approaches require large labelled datasets which are hard to
acquire for sensitive data such as maintenance records. Further, industrial
domain experts tend to distrust results from black box machine learning models,
especially when the extracted information is used in downstream predictive
maintenance analytics. We overcome these challenges by developing three
approaches built on the foundation of domain expert knowledge captured in
dictionaries and ontologies. We develop a syntactic and semantic rules-based
approach and an approach leveraging a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned
for a question-answering task on top of our base dictionary lookup to extract
entities of interest from maintenance records. We also develop a preliminary
ontology to represent and capture the semantics of maintenance records. Our
evaluations on a real-world aviation maintenance records dataset show promising
results and help identify challenges specific to named entity recognition in
the context of noisy industrial data.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, some studies have shown that text classification tasks are
vulnerable to poisoning and evasion attacks. However, little work has
investigated attacks against decision making algorithms that use text
embeddings, and their output is a ranking. In this paper, we focus on ranking
algorithms for recruitment process, that employ text embeddings for ranking
applicants resumes when compared to a job description. We demonstrate both
white box and black box attacks that identify text items, that based on their
location in embedding space, have significant contribution in increasing the
similarity score between a resume and a job description. The adversary then
uses these text items to improve the ranking of their resume among others. We
tested recruitment algorithms that use the similarity scores obtained from
Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
(TF IDF) vectors. Our results show that in both adversarial settings, on
average the attacker is successful. We also found that attacks against TF IDF
is more successful compared to USE.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05540">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using fine-tuned language
models~(LM) for dense retrieval. However, dense retrievers are hard to train,
typically requiring heavily engineered fine-tuning pipelines to realize their
full potential. In this paper, we identify and address two underlying problems
of dense retrievers: i)~fragility to training data noise and ii)~requiring
large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently
proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense
information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we
propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss
to warm up the passage embedding space. Retrieval experiments on MS-MARCO,
Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need
for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, as
well as the need for large batch training. It shows comparable performance to
RocketQA, a state-of-the-art, heavily engineered system, using simple small
batch fine-tuning.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer-based pretrained language models (T-PTLMs) have achieved great
success in almost every NLP task. The evolution of these models started with
GPT and BERT. These models are built on the top of transformers,
self-supervised learning and transfer learning. Transformed-based PTLMs learn
universal language representations from large volumes of text data using
self-supervised learning and transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. These
models provide good background knowledge to downstream tasks which avoids
training of downstream models from scratch. In this comprehensive survey paper,
we initially give a brief overview of self-supervised learning. Next, we
explain various core concepts like pretraining, pretraining methods,
pretraining tasks, embeddings and downstream adaptation methods. Next, we
present a new taxonomy of T-PTLMs and then give brief overview of various
benchmarks including both intrinsic and extrinsic. We present a summary of
various useful libraries to work with T-PTLMs. Finally, we highlight some of
the future research directions which will further improve these models. We
strongly believe that this comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good
reference to learn the core concepts as well as to stay updated with the recent
happenings in T-PTLMs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05652">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have been applied to
document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's
view. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of "real users"
while the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's
view and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art
performances.

<span><p>Text generation from semantic graphs is traditionally performed with
deterministic methods, which generate a unique description given an input
graph. However, the generation problem admits a range of acceptable textual

disconnect, we present two main contributions. First, we propose a stochastic
graph-to-text model, incorporating a latent variable in an encoder-decoder

generated sentences, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric which jointly
evaluates output diversity and quality in a multi-reference setting. We
evaluate the models on WebNLG datasets in English and Russian, and show an

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05669">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Scientific silos can hinder innovation. These information "filter bubbles"
and the growing challenge of information overload limit awareness across the
literature, making it difficult to keep track of even narrow areas of interest,
let alone discover new ones. Algorithmic curation and recommendation, which
often prioritize relevance, can further reinforce these bubbles. In response,
we describe Bridger, a system for facilitating discovery of scholars and their
work, to explore design tradeoffs among relevant and novel recommendations. We
construct a faceted representation of authors using information extracted from
their papers and inferred personas. We explore approaches both for recommending
new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to
understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with
computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users'
abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and
contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather
than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover
authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work,
at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model. Our analysis reveals that
Bridger connects authors who have different citation profiles, publish in
different venues, and are more distant in social co-authorship networks,
raising the prospect of bridging diverse communities and facilitating
discovery.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05682">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In the domain of Morphology, Inflection is a fundamental and important task
that gained a lot of traction in recent years, mostly via SIGMORPHON's
shared-tasks. With average accuracy above 0.9 over the scores of all languages,
the task is considered mostly solved using relatively generic neural
sequence-to-sequence models, even with little data provided. In this work, we
propose to re-evaluate morphological inflection models by employing harder
train-test splits that will challenge the generalization capacity of the
models. In particular, as opposed to the na\"ive split-by-form, we propose a
split-by-lemma method to challenge the performance on existing benchmarks. Our
experiments with the three top-ranked systems on the SIGMORPHON's 2020
shared-task show that the lemma-split presents an average drop of 30 percentage
points in macro-average for the 90 languages included. The effect is most
significant for low-resourced languages with a drop as high as 95 points, but
even high-resourced languages lose about 10 points on average. Our results
clearly show that generalizing inflection to unseen lemmas is far from being
solved, presenting a simple yet effective means to promote more sophisticated
models.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05774">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, several Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) approaches have been
devised to represent entities and relations in dense vector space and employed
in downstream tasks such as link prediction. A few KGE techniques address
interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.

<span><p>Fine-tuned language models use greedy decoding to answer reading
comprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not
ensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee
that it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse
than an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the
performance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a
decoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the
context. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on
zero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples
are available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.
However, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of
exact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more
extractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the
training set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the
model towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot
setting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest
that pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question
answering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the
greedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.

<span><p>Moving towards human-like linguistic performance is often argued to require
compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
typically studied using artificial languages, for which the compositionality of
input fragments can be guaranteed and their meanings algebraically composed.
However, compositionality in natural language is vastly more complex than this
rigid, arithmetics-like version of compositionality, and as such artificial
compositionality tests do not allow us to draw conclusions about how neural
models deal with compositionality in more realistic scenarios. In this work, we
re-instantiate three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate
them for neural machine translation (NMT). The results highlight two main
issues: the inconsistent behaviour of NMT models and their inability to
(correctly) modulate between local and global processing. Aside from an
empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink the evaluation
of compositionality in neural networks of natural language, where composing

<p>We show that over infinite trees there is a hierarchy of degrees of
ambiguity: For every k &gt; 1 there are k-ambiguous languages that are not k - 1
ambiguous; and there are finitely (respectively countably, uncountably)
ambiguous languages that are not boundedly (respectively finitely, countably)
ambiguous.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14891">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>A cyclic proof system allows us to perform inductive reasoning without
explicit inductions. We propose a cyclic proof system for HFLN, which is a
higher-order predicate logic with natural numbers and alternating fixed-points.
Ours is the first cyclic proof system for a higher-order logic, to our
knowledge. Due to the presence of higher-order predicates and alternating
fixed-points, our cyclic proof system requires a more delicate global condition
on cyclic proofs than the original system of Brotherston and Simpson. We prove
the decidability of checking the global condition and soundness of this system,
and also prove a restricted form of standard completeness for an infinitary
variant of our cyclic proof system. A potential application of our cyclic proof
system is semi-automated verification of higher-order programs, based on
Kobayashi et al.'s recent work on reductions from program verification to HFLN
validity checking.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00451">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent methods for visual question answering rely on large-scale annotated
datasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is
tedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid
manual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video
question answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage
a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate
question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,
we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M
video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse
answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive
loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer
transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent
results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method
to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA,
ActivityNet-QA and How2QA. Finally, for a detailed evaluation we introduce
iVQA, a new VideoQA dataset with reduced language biases and high-quality
redundant manual annotations. Our code, datasets and trained models are
available at https://antoyang.github.io/just-ask.html.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08231">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Word alignment over parallel corpora has a wide variety of applications,
including learning translation lexicons, cross-lingual transfer of language
processing tools, and automatic evaluation or analysis of translation outputs.
The great majority of past work on word alignment has worked by performing
unsupervised learning on parallel texts. Recently, however, other work has
demonstrated that pre-trained contextualized word embeddings derived from
multilingually trained language models (LMs) prove an attractive alternative,
achieving competitive results on the word alignment task even in the absence of
explicit training on parallel data. In this paper, we examine methods to marry
the two approaches: leveraging pre-trained LMs but fine-tuning them on parallel
text with objectives designed to improve alignment quality, and proposing
methods to effectively extract alignments from these fine-tuned models. We
perform experiments on five language pairs and demonstrate that our model can
consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art models of all varieties. In
addition, we demonstrate that we are able to train multilingual word aligners
that can obtain robust performance on different language pairs. Our aligner,
AWESOME (Aligning Word Embedding Spaces of Multilingual Encoders), with
pre-trained models is available at https://github.com/neulab/awesome-align

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02207">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become
increasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech
recognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E)
speech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and
their variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart
from being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low
user-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This
work examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training
criteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our
analyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes),
or measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability
to process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL.
Thus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in
accurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded
devices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and
endpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off
between latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with
endpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization
mechanism.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05498">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Accurate terminology translation is crucial for ensuring the practicality and
reliability of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. To address this,
lexically constrained NMT explores various methods to ensure pre-specified
words and phrases appear in the translation output. However, in many cases,
those methods are studied on general domain corpora, where the terms are mostly
uni- and bi-grams (&gt;98%). In this paper, we instead tackle a more challenging
setup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly
specialized terms. Inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction
models, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves
consistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for
three domain-specific corpora in two language pairs.
