<summary class="article-expander__title">Don't Discard All the Biased Instances: Investigating a Core Assumption in Dataset Bias Mitigation Techniques. (arXiv:2109.00521v1 [cs.LG])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00521">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Existing techniques for mitigating dataset bias often leverage a biased model
to identify biased instances. The role of these biased instances is then
reduced during the training of the main model to enhance its robustness to
out-of-distribution data. A common core assumption of these techniques is that
the main model handles biased instances similarly to the biased model, in that
it will resort to biases whenever available. In this paper, we show that this
assumption does not hold in general. We carry out a critical investigation on
two well-known datasets in the domain, MNLI and FEVER, along with two biased
instance detection methods, partial-input and limited-capacity models. Our
experiments show that in around a third to a half of instances, the biased
model is unable to predict the main model's behavior, highlighted by the
significantly different parts of the input on which they base their decisions.
Based on a manual validation, we also show that this estimate is highly in line
with human interpretation. Our findings suggest that down-weighting of
instances detected by bias detection methods, which is a widely-practiced
procedure, is an unnecessary waste of training data. We release our code to
facilitate reproducibility and future research.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00523">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Data augmentation aims to enrich training samples for alleviating the
overfitting issue in low-resource or class-imbalanced situations. Traditional
methods first devise task-specific operations such as Synonym Substitute, then
preset the corresponding parameters such as the substitution rate artificially,
which require a lot of prior knowledge and are prone to fall into the
sub-optimum. Besides, the number of editing operations is limited in the
previous methods, which decreases the diversity of the augmented data and thus
restricts the performance gain. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
framework named Text AutoAugment (TAA) to establish a compositional and
learnable paradigm for data augmentation. We regard a combination of various
operations as an augmentation policy and utilize an efficient Bayesian
Optimization algorithm to automatically search for the best policy, which
substantially improves the generalization capability of models. Experiments on
six benchmark datasets show that TAA boosts classification accuracy in
low-resource and class-imbalanced regimes by an average of 8.8% and 9.7%,
respectively, outperforming strong baselines.

<span><p>Can machines learn to use a search engine as an interactive tool for finding

machine reading to guide the selection of refinement terms from aggregated
search results. Agents are then empowered with simple but effective search
operators to exert fine-grained and transparent control over queries and search
results. We develop a novel way of generating synthetic search sessions, which
leverages the power of transformer-based generative language models through
(self-)supervised learning. We also present a reinforcement learning agent with
dynamically constrained actions that can learn interactive search strategies

one-shot search with a strong information retrieval baseline. Finally, we
provide an in-depth analysis of the learned search policies.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00544">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Adversarial training, a method for learning robust deep neural networks,
constructs adversarial examples during training. However, recent methods for
generating NLP adversarial examples involve combinatorial search and expensive
sentence encoders for constraining the generated instances. As a result, it
remains challenging to use vanilla adversarial training to improve NLP models'
performance, and the benefits are mainly uninvestigated. This paper proposes a
simple and improved vanilla adversarial training process for NLP, which we name
Attacking to Training ($\texttt{A2T}$). The core part of $\texttt{A2T}$ is a
new and cheaper word substitution attack optimized for vanilla adversarial
training. We use $\texttt{A2T}$ to train BERT and RoBERTa models on IMDB,
Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and SNLI datasets. Our results show that it is possible
to train empirically robust NLP models using a much cheaper adversary. We
demonstrate that vanilla adversarial training with $\texttt{A2T}$ can improve
an NLP model's robustness to the attack it was originally trained with and also
defend the model against other types of attacks. Furthermore, we show that
$\texttt{A2T}$ can improve NLP models' standard accuracy, cross-domain
generalization, and interpretability. Code is available at

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>It is often observed in knowledge-centric tasks (e.g., common sense question
and answering, relation classification) that the integration of external
knowledge such as entity representation into language models can help provide
useful information to boost the performance. However, it is still unclear
whether this benefit can extend to general natural language understanding (NLU)
tasks. In this work, we empirically investigated the contribution of external
knowledge by measuring the end-to-end performance of language models with
various knowledge integration methods. We find that the introduction of
knowledge can significantly improve the results on certain tasks while having
no adverse effects on other tasks. We then employ mutual information to reflect
the difference brought by knowledge and a neural interpretation model to reveal
how a language model utilizes external knowledge. Our study provides valuable
insights and guidance for practitioners to equip NLP models with knowledge.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00571">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The rise of pre-trained language models has yielded substantial progress in
the vast majority of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, a
generic approach towards the pre-training procedure can naturally be
sub-optimal in some cases. Particularly, fine-tuning a pre-trained language
model on a source domain and then applying it to a different target domain,
results in a sharp performance decline of the eventual classifier for many
source-target domain pairs. Moreover, in some NLP tasks, the output categories
substantially differ between domains, making adaptation even more challenging.
This, for example, happens in the task of aspect extraction, where the aspects
of interest of reviews of, e.g., restaurants or electronic devices may be very
different. This paper presents a new fine-tuning scheme for BERT, which aims to
address the above challenges. We name this scheme DILBERT: Domain Invariant
Learning with BERT, and customize it for aspect extraction in the unsupervised
domain adaptation setting. DILBERT harnesses the categorical information of
both the source and the target domains to guide the pre-training process
towards a more domain and category invariant representation, thus closing the
gap between the domains. We show that DILBERT yields substantial improvements
over state-of-the-art baselines while using a fraction of the unlabeled data,
particularly in more challenging domain adaptation setups.

<span><p>Web search is fundamentally multimodal and multihop. Often, even before
asking a question we choose to go directly to image search to find our answers.
Further, rarely do we find an answer from a single source but aggregate

everyday occurrence, at present, there is no unified question answering
benchmark that requires a single model to answer long-form natural language
questions from text and open-ended visual sources -- akin to a human's

<span><p>Point-of-interest (POI) type prediction is the task of inferring the type of
a place from where a social media post was shared. Inferring a POI's type is
useful for studies in computational social science including sociolinguistics,

networking technologies such as recommendation and visualization systems. Prior
efforts in POI type prediction focus solely on text, without taking visual
information into account. However in reality, the variety of modalities, as

prediction using multimodal information from text and images available at

POI type prediction with the images that accompany the text messages. Our
proposed method extracts relevant information from each modality to effectively
capture interactions between text and image achieving a macro F1 of 47.21

end-to-end ASR models in a neural-symbolic way. TCPGen structures the biasing
words into an efficient prefix tree to serve as its symbolic input and creates
a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output distribution to
facilitate recognising biasing words during decoding. Systems were trained and
evaluated on the Librispeech corpus where biasing words were extracted at the

introducing the modeling of dialogue characteristics into the NCT model. To
this end, we design four auxiliary tasks including monolingual response

optimize the NCT model through the training objectives of all these tasks. By
this means, the NCT model can be enhanced by capturing the inherent dialogue

<span><p>NER in low-resource languages or domains suffers from inadequate training

the challenge that the target domain has different label sets compared with a

domain transfer problems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight generative
framework with prompt-guided attention for low-resource NER (LightNER) to
address these issues. Concretely, instead of tackling the problem by training
label-specific discriminative classifiers, we convert sequence labeling to
generate the entity pointer index sequence and entity categories without any
label-specific classifiers, which can address the class transfer issue. We
further propose prompt-guided attention by incorporating continuous prompts
into the self-attention layer to re-modulate the attention and adapt
pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune those continuous prompts with the
whole parameter of the pre-trained language model fixed, thus, making our
approach lightweight and flexible for low-resource scenarios and can better
transfer knowledge across domains. Experimental results show that by tuning
only 0.16% of the parameters, LightNER can obtain comparable performance in the
standard setting and outperform standard sequence labeling and prototype-based
methods in low-resource settings.

We lastly use the expanded queries to fine-tune BERT and RoBERTa for intent

<span><p>Automatic news recommendation has gained much attention from the academic
community and industry. Recent studies reveal that the key to this task lies
within the effective representation learning of both news and users. Existing
works typically encode news title and content separately while neglecting their
semantic interaction, which is inadequate for news text comprehension. Besides,
previous models encode user browsing history without leveraging the structural
correlation of user browsed news to reflect user interests explicitly. In this
work, we propose a news recommendation framework consisting of collaborative
news encoding (CNE) and structural user encoding (SUE) to enhance news and user
representation learning. CNE equipped with bidirectional LSTMs encodes news
title and content collaboratively with cross-selection and cross-attention
modules to learn semantic-interactive news representations. SUE utilizes graph
convolutional networks to extract cluster-structural features of user history,
followed by intra-cluster and inter-cluster attention modules to learn
hierarchical user interest representations. Experiment results on the MIND
dataset validate the effectiveness of our model to improve the performance of
news recommendation. Our code is released at

<span><p>Developing automatic Math Word Problem (MWP) solvers has been an interest of
NLP researchers since the 1960s. Over the last few years, there are a growing
number of datasets and deep learning-based methods proposed for effectively
solving MWPs. However, most existing methods are benchmarked soly on one or two
datasets, varying in different configurations, which leads to a lack of
unified, standardized, fair, and comprehensive comparison between methods. This
paper presents MWPToolkit, the first open-source framework for solving MWPs. In
MWPToolkit, we decompose the procedure of existing MWP solvers into multiple
core components and decouple their models into highly reusable modules. We also
provide a hyper-parameter search function to boost the performance. In total,
we implement and compare 17 MWP solvers on 4 widely-used single equation
generation benchmarks and 2 multiple equations generation benchmarks. These
features enable our MWPToolkit to be suitable for researchers to reproduce
advanced baseline models and develop new MWP solvers quickly. Code and

graph structure. Given a sentence (unstructured text) and its graph, we use
contrastive learning to impose relation-related structure on the token-level
representations of the sentence obtained with a CharacterBERT (El Boukkouri et

state-of-the-art results on the relation extraction task using only a simple
KNN classifier, thereby demonstrating the success of the proposed method.
Additional visualization by a tSNE analysis shows the effectiveness of the

we can learn a different space for named entity recognition, again using a
contrastive learning objective, and demonstrate how to successfully combine

suboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code

seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for
multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training

the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better
NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly

modality-noise, which are two pervasive problems of multi-modal product data in
real E-commerce scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel method, K3M, which
introduces knowledge modality in multi-modal pretraining to correct the noise
and supplement the missing of image and text modalities. The modal-encoding
layer extracts the features of each modality. The modal-interaction layer is
capable of effectively modeling the interaction of multiple modalities, where
an initial-interactive feature fusion model is designed to maintain the
independence of image modality and text modality, and a structure aggregation
module is designed to fuse the information of image, text, and knowledge
modalities. We pretrain K3M with three pretraining tasks, including masked
object modeling (MOM), masked language modeling (MLM), and link prediction
modeling (LPM). Experimental results on a real-world E-commerce dataset and a

<span><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have made great progress in NLP.
News articles usually contain rich textual information, and PLMs have the
potentials to enhance news text modeling for various intelligent news
applications like news recommendation and retrieval. However, most existing
PLMs are in huge size with hundreds of millions of parameters. Many online news
applications need to serve millions of users with low latency tolerance, which
poses huge challenges to incorporating PLMs in these scenarios. Knowledge
distillation techniques can compress a large PLM into a much smaller one and
meanwhile keeps good performance. However, existing language models are
pre-trained and distilled on general corpus like Wikipedia, which has some gaps
with the news domain and may be suboptimal for news intelligence. In this
paper, we propose NewsBERT, which can distill PLMs for efficient and effective
news intelligence. In our approach, we design a teacher-student joint learning
and distillation framework to collaboratively learn both teacher and student
models, where the student model can learn from the learning experience of the
teacher model. In addition, we propose a momentum distillation method by
incorporating the gradients of teacher model into the update of student model
to better transfer useful knowledge learned by the teacher model. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets with three tasks show that NewsBERT can
effectively improve the model performance in various intelligent news
applications with much smaller models.

<span><p>Empirical natural language processing (NLP) systems in application domains

framework to support fast development of such sophisticated NLP workflows in a
composable manner. The framework introduces a uniform data representation to
encode heterogeneous results by a wide range of NLP tasks. It offers a large
repository of processors for NLP tasks, visualization, and annotation, which
can be easily assembled with full interoperability under the unified
representation. The highly extensible framework allows plugging in custom
processors from external off-the-shelf NLP and deep learning libraries. The
whole framework is delivered through two modularized yet integratable
open-source projects, namely Forte (for workflow infrastructure and NLP
function processors) and Stave (for user interaction, visualization, and

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Colexification refers to the phenomenon of multiple meanings sharing one word
in a language. Cross-linguistic lexification patterns have been shown to be
largely predictable, as similar concepts are often colexified. We test a recent
claim that, beyond this general tendency, communicative needs play an important
role in shaping colexification patterns. We approach this question by means of
a series of human experiments, using an artificial language communication game
paradigm. Our results across four experiments match the previous
cross-linguistic findings: all other things being equal, speakers do prefer to
colexify similar concepts. However, we also find evidence supporting the
communicative need hypothesis: when faced with a frequent need to distinguish
similar pairs of meanings, speakers adjust their colexification preferences to
maintain communicative efficiency, and avoid colexifying those similar meanings
which need to be distinguished in communication. This research provides further
evidence to support the argument that languages are shaped by the needs and
preferences of their speakers.

<span><p>In this work, we explore "prompt tuning", a simple yet effective mechanism
for learning "soft prompts" to condition frozen language models to perform
specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft
prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate
signal from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach
outperforms GPT-3's "few-shot" learning by a large margin. More remarkably,
through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes
more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our
method "closes the gap" and matches the strong performance of model tuning
(where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant in
that large models are costly to share and serve, and the ability to reuse one
frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can
be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed "prefix tuning" of Li and
Liang (2021), and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches.
Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers
benefits in robustness to domain transfer, as compared to full model tuning.

<span><p>Humans use commonsense reasoning (CSR) implicitly to produce natural and

understand why RG models respond as they do by probing RG model's understanding
of commonsense reasoning that elicits proper responses. We formalize the
problem by framing commonsense as a latent variable in the RG task and using
explanations for responses as textual form of commonsense. We collect 6k
annotated explanations justifying responses from four dialogue datasets and ask
humans to verify them and propose two probing settings to evaluate RG models'
CSR capabilities. Probing results show that models fail to capture the logical
relations between commonsense explanations and responses and fine-tuning on

the human reasoning process in pursuit of smooth human-AI communication.

<span><p>Transformer has achieved great success in NLP. However, the quadratic
complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer makes it inefficient
in handling long sequences. Many existing works explore to accelerate
Transformers by computing sparse self-attention instead of a dense one, which
usually attends to tokens at certain positions or randomly selected tokens.
However, manually selected or random tokens may be uninformative for context
modeling. In this paper, we propose Smart Bird, which is an efficient and
effective Transformer with learnable sparse attention. In Smart Bird, we first
compute a sketched attention matrix with a single-head low-dimensional
Transformer, which aims to find potential important interactions between
tokens. We then sample token pairs based on their probability scores derived
from the sketched attention matrix to generate different sparse attention index
matrices for different attention heads. Finally, we select token embeddings
according to the index matrices to form the input of sparse attention networks.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets for different tasks validate
the efficiency and effectiveness of Smart Bird in text modeling.

<span><p>Personalized chatbots focus on endowing chatbots with a consistent
personality to behave like real users, give more informative responses, and
further act as personal assistants. Existing personalized approaches tried to
incorporate several text descriptions as explicit user profiles. However, the
acquisition of such explicit profiles is expensive and time-consuming, thus
being impractical for large-scale real-world applications. Moreover, the
restricted predefined profile neglects the language behavior of a real user and
cannot be automatically updated together with the change of user interests. In
this paper, we propose to learn implicit user profiles automatically from
large-scale user dialogue history for building personalized chatbots.
Specifically, leveraging the benefits of Transformer on language understanding,
we train a personalized language model to construct a general user profile from
the user's historical responses. To highlight the relevant historical responses
to the input post, we further establish a key-value memory network of
historical post-response pairs, and build a dynamic post-aware user profile.
The dynamic profile mainly describes what and how the user has responded to
similar posts in history. To explicitly utilize users' frequently used words,
we design a personalized decoder to fuse two decoding strategies, including
generating a word from the generic vocabulary and copying one word from the
user's personalized vocabulary. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the
significant improvement of our model compared with existing methods. Our code

<span><p>In joint entity and relation extraction, existing work either sequentially
encode task-specific features, leading to an imbalance in inter-task feature
interaction where features extracted later have no direct contact with those

parallel manner, meaning that feature representation learning for each task is
largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on five public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary
to what previous work claims, our auxiliary experiments suggest that relation
prediction is contributory to named entity prediction in a non-negligible way.

However, those methods are trivial by using hard-label decisions to activate
