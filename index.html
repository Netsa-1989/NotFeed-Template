<summary class="article-expander__title">SS-BERT: Mitigating Identity Terms Bias in Toxic Comment Classification by Utilising the Notion of "Subjectivity" and "Identity Terms". (arXiv:2109.02691v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02691">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Toxic comment classification models are often found biased toward identity
terms which are terms characterizing a specific group of people such as
"Muslim" and "black". Such bias is commonly reflected in false-positive
predictions, i.e. non-toxic comments with identity terms. In this work, we
propose a novel approach to tackle such bias in toxic comment classification,
leveraging the notion of subjectivity level of a comment and the presence of
identity terms. We hypothesize that when a comment is made about a group of
people that is characterized by an identity term, the likelihood of that
comment being toxic is associated with the subjectivity level of the comment,
i.e. the extent to which the comment conveys personal feelings and opinions.
Building upon the BERT model, we propose a new structure that is able to
leverage these features, and thoroughly evaluate our model on 4 datasets of
varying sizes and representing different social media platforms. The results
show that our model can consistently outperform BERT and a SOTA model devised
to address identity term bias in a different way, with a maximum improvement in
F1 of 2.43% and 1.91% respectively.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02707">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We study a new problem setting of information extraction (IE), referred to as
text-to-table, which can be viewed as an inverse problem of the well-studied
table-to-text. In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several
tables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from
text-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing
methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to
large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely
data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as
we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this
work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem.
We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to
perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach,
exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and
table relation embeddings. We make use of four existing table-to-text datasets
in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla
seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction
and named entity extraction. The results also show that our method can further
boost the performances of the vanilla seq2seq model. We further discuss the
main challenges of the proposed task. The code and data will be made publicly
available.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02738">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>People convey their intention and attitude through linguistic styles of the
text that they write. In this study, we investigate lexicon usages across
styles throughout two lenses: human perception and machine word importance,
since words differ in the strength of the stylistic cues that they provide. To
collect labels of human perception, we curate a new dataset, Hummingbird, on
top of benchmarking style datasets. We have crowd workers highlight the
representative words in the text that makes them think the text has the
following styles: politeness, sentiment, offensiveness, and five emotion types.
We then compare these human word labels with word importance derived from a
popular fine-tuned style classifier like BERT. Our results show that the BERT
often finds content words not relevant to the target style as important words
used in style prediction, but humans do not perceive the same way even though
for some styles (e.g., positive sentiment and joy) human- and
machine-identified words share significant overlap for some styles.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Most previous studies on information status (IS) classification and bridging
anaphora recognition assume that the gold mention or syntactic tree information
is given (Hou et al., 2013; Roesiger et al., 2018; Hou, 2020; Yu and Poesio,
2020). In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural approach for information
status classification. Our approach consists of a mention extraction component
and an information status assignment component. During the inference time, our
system takes a raw text as the input and generates mentions together with their
information status. On the ISNotes corpus (Markert et al., 2012), we show that
our information status assignment component achieves new state-of-the-art
results on fine-grained IS classification based on gold mentions. Furthermore,
our system performs significantly better than other baselines for both mention
extraction and fine-grained IS classification in the end-to-end setting.
Finally, we apply our system on BASHI (Roesiger, 2018) and SciCorp (Roesiger,
2016) to recognize referential bridging anaphora. We find that our end-to-end
system trained on ISNotes achieves competitive results on bridging anaphora

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02789">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pretrained contextualized representations offer great success for many
downstream tasks, including document ranking. The multilingual versions of such
pretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many
languages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such
joint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the
models under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of
performance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the
performance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In
the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is
easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents.
However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different
languages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate
query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context,
in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This
property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur
in both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed
Attention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge,
such as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like
architecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models.
By encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with
MAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge
and the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR
task.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Commonsense reasoning benchmarks have been largely solved by fine-tuning
language models. The downside is that fine-tuning may cause models to overfit
to task-specific data and thereby forget their knowledge gained during
pre-training. Recent works only propose lightweight model updates as models may
already possess useful knowledge from past experience, but a challenge remains
in understanding what parts and to what extent models should be refined for a
given task. In this paper, we investigate what models learn from commonsense
reasoning datasets. We measure the impact of three different adaptation methods
on the generalization and accuracy of models. Our experiments with two models
show that fine-tuning performs best, by learning both the content and the
structure of the task, but suffers from overfitting and limited generalization
to novel answers. We observe that alternative adaptation methods like
prefix-tuning have comparable accuracy, but generalize better to unseen answers

a large unlabeled corpus into multiple clusters, and trains multiple UMT models

these UMT models, a unified surrogate model can be trained to serve as the
final Seq2Seq model to generate paraphrases, which can be directly used for

auto-regressive GPT-2 as decoder. With the combination of the pre-trained
RoBERTa and GPT-2, our model realizes a new state-of-the-art emotion accuracy.
To enable the empathetic ability of RoBERTa-GPT2 model, we propose a

commonsensible and emotional concepts of dialogue context are extracted for the
GPT-2 decoder. The experiment results demonstrate that the empathetic dialogue
generation benefits from both pre-trained encoder-decoder architecture and

<span><p>Recently, large pre-trained neural language models have attained remarkable
performance on many downstream natural language processing (NLP) applications
via fine-tuning. In this paper, we target at how to further improve the token
representations on the language models. We, therefore, propose a simple yet
effective plug-and-play module, Sequential Attention Module (SAM), on the token
embeddings learned from a pre-trained language model. Our proposed SAM consists
of two main attention modules deployed sequentially: Feature-wise Attention
Module (FAM) and Token-wise Attention Module (TAM). More specifically, FAM can
effectively identify the importance of features at each dimension and promote
the effect via dot-product on the original token embeddings for downstream NLP
applications. Meanwhile, TAM can further re-weight the features at the
token-wise level. Moreover, we propose an adaptive filter on FAM to prevent
noise impact and increase information absorption. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate the advantages and properties of our proposed SAM.
We first show how SAM plays a primary role in the champion solution of two
subtasks of SemEval'21 Task 7. After that, we apply SAM on sentiment analysis
and three popular NLP tasks and demonstrate that SAM consistently outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines.

<span><p>Math word problem (MWP) is a challenging and critical task in natural
language processing. Many recent studies formalize MWP as a generation task and

mistakes while the generation objective does not explicitly handle such

<span><p>This paper explores augmenting monolingual data for knowledge distillation in
neural machine translation. Source language monolingual text can be
incorporated as a forward translation. Interestingly, we find the best way to
incorporate target language monolingual text is to translate it to the source
language and round-trip translate it back to the target language, resulting in
a fully synthetic corpus. We find that combining monolingual data from both
source and target languages yields better performance than a corpus twice as
large only in one language. Moreover, experiments reveal that the improvement
depends upon the provenance of the test set. If the test set was originally in
the source language (with the target side written by translators), then forward
translating source monolingual data matters. If the test set was originally in
the target language (with the source written by translators), then
incorporating target monolingual data matters.

<span><p>Transformers have shown improved performance when compared to previous
architectures for sequence processing such as RNNs. Despite their sizeable
performance gains, as recently suggested, the model is computationally
expensive to train and with a high parameter budget. In light of this, we
explore parameter-sharing methods in Transformers with a specific focus on
generative models. We perform an analysis of different parameter
sharing/reduction methods and develop the Subformer. Our model combines
sandwich-style parameter sharing, which overcomes naive cross-layer parameter
sharing in generative models, and self-attentive embedding factorization
(SAFE). Experiments on machine translation, abstractive summarization and
language modeling show that the Subformer can outperform the Transformer even
when using significantly fewer parameters.

<span><p>Previous work in slogan generation focused on utilising slogan skeletons
mined from existing slogans. While some generated slogans can be catchy, they
are often not coherent with the company's focus or style across their marketing
communications because the skeletons are mined from other companies' slogans.
We propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transformer model to generate
slogans from a brief company description. A naive seq2seq model fine-tuned for
slogan generation is prone to introducing false information. We use company
name delexicalisation and entity masking to alleviate this problem and improve
the generated slogans' quality and truthfulness. Furthermore, we apply
conditional training based on the first words' POS tag to generate
syntactically diverse slogans. Our best model achieved a ROUGE-1/-2/-L F1 score
of 35.58/18.47/33.32. Besides, automatic and human evaluations indicate that
our method generates significantly more factual, diverse and catchy slogans
than strong LSTM and transformer seq2seq baselines.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03598">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Intersectional bias is a bias caused by an overlap of multiple social factors
like gender, sexuality, race, disability, religion, etc. A recent study has
shown that word embedding models can be laden with biases against
intersectional groups like African American females, etc. The first step
towards tackling such intersectional biases is to identify them. However,
discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a
challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool
designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word
embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the
association of each word along different groups based on race, age, etc. and
then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study,
we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional
groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding.
In addition, we also evaluate our tool using qualitative feedback from expert
interviews. The source code for this tool can be publicly accessed for
reproducibility at github.com/bhavyaghai/WordBias.

<span><p>Generating paragraphs of diverse contents is important in many applications.
Existing generation models produce similar contents from homogenized contexts

We propose a novel framework PermGen whose objective is to maximize the
expected log-likelihood of output paragraph distributions with respect to all
possible sentence orders. PermGen uses hierarchical positional embedding and
designs new procedures for training, decoding, and candidate ranking in the
sentence-permuted generation. Experiments on three paragraph generation
benchmarks demonstrate PermGen generates more diverse outputs with a higher

<span><p>Identifying political perspective in news media has become an important task
due to the rapid growth of political commentary and the increasingly polarized
ideologies. Previous approaches only focus on leveraging the semantic
information and leaves out the rich social and political context that helps
individuals understand political stances. In this paper, we propose a
perspective detection method that incorporates external knowledge of real-world
politics. Specifically, we construct a contemporary political knowledge graph
with 1,071 entities and 10,703 triples. We then build a heterogeneous
information network for each news document that jointly models article
semantics and external knowledge in knowledge graphs. Finally, we apply gated
relational graph convolutional networks and conduct political perspective
detection as graph-level classification. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves the best performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
by 5.49%. Numerous ablation studies further bear out the necessity of external
knowledge and the effectiveness of our graph-based approach.

<span><p>Political stance detection has become an important task due to the
increasingly polarized political ideologies. Most existing works focus on
identifying perspectives in news articles or social media posts, while social
entities, such as individuals and organizations, produce these texts and
actually take stances. In this paper, we propose the novel task of entity
stance prediction, which aims to predict entities' stances given their social
and political context. Specifically, we retrieve facts from Wikipedia about
social entities regarding contemporary U.S. politics. We then annotate social
entities' stances towards political ideologies with the help of domain experts.
After defining the task of entity stance prediction, we propose a graph-based
solution, which constructs a heterogeneous information network from collected
facts and adopts gated relational graph convolutional networks for
representation learning. Our model is then trained with a combination of
supervised, self-supervised and unsupervised loss functions, which are
motivated by multiple social and political phenomenons. We conduct extensive
experiments to compare our method with existing text and graph analysis
baselines. Our model achieves highest stance detection accuracy and yields
inspiring insights regarding social entity stances. We further conduct ablation

<span><p>While deep learning models have greatly improved the performance of most
artificial intelligence tasks, they are often criticized to be untrustworthy
due to the black-box problem. Consequently, many works have been proposed to
study the trustworthiness of deep learning. However, as most open datasets are
designed for evaluating the accuracy of model outputs, there is still a lack of
appropriate datasets for evaluating the inner workings of neural networks. The
lack of datasets obviously hinders the development of trustworthiness research.
Therefore, in order to systematically evaluate the factors for building
trustworthy systems, we propose a novel and well-annotated sentiment analysis
dataset to evaluate robustness and interpretability. To evaluate these factors,
our dataset contains diverse annotations about the challenging distribution of
instances, manual adversarial instances and sentiment explanations. Several
evaluation metrics are further proposed for interpretability and robustness.
Based on the dataset and metrics, we conduct comprehensive comparisons for the
trustworthiness of three typical models, and also study the relations between
accuracy, robustness and interpretability. We release this trustworthiness
evaluation dataset at \url{https://github/xyz} and hope our work can facilitate
the progress on building more trustworthy systems for real-world applications.

<span><p>The sheer volume of financial statements makes it difficult for humans to

faces unique challenges in this domain. In this work, we focus on answering
deep questions over financial data, aiming to automate the analysis of a large
corpus of financial documents. In contrast to existing tasks on general domain,
the finance domain includes complex numerical reasoning and understanding of
heterogeneous representations. To facilitate analytical progress, we propose a
new large-scale dataset, FinQA, with Question-Answering pairs over Financial
reports, written by financial experts. We also annotate the gold reasoning
programs to ensure full explainability. We further introduce baselines and
conduct comprehensive experiments in our dataset. The results demonstrate that
popular, large, pre-trained models fall far short of expert humans in acquiring
finance knowledge and in complex multi-step numerical reasoning on that
knowledge. Our dataset -- the first of its kind -- should therefore enable
significant, new community research into complex application domains. The

<span><p>We introduce MULTI-EURLEX, a new multilingual dataset for topic
classification of legal documents. The dataset comprises 65k European Union
(EU) laws, officially translated in 23 languages, annotated with multiple
labels from the EUROVOC taxonomy. We highlight the effect of temporal concept
drift and the importance of chronological, instead of random splits. We use the
dataset as a testbed for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, where we exploit
annotated training documents in one language (source) to classify documents in
another language (target). We find that fine-tuning a multilingually pretrained
model (XLM-ROBERTA, MT5) in a single source language leads to catastrophic
forgetting of multilingual knowledge and, consequently, poor zero-shot transfer
to other languages. Adaptation strategies, namely partial fine-tuning,
adapters, BITFIT, LNFIT, originally proposed to accelerate fine-tuning for new
end-tasks, help retain multilingual knowledge from pretraining, substantially
improving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, but their impact also depends on
the pretrained model used and the size of the label set.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02403">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) aims at identifying the
sentiment polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. ALSC is a practical
setting in aspect-based sentiment analysis due to no opinion term labeling
needed, but it fails to interpret why a sentiment polarity is derived for the
aspect. To address this problem, recent works fine-tune pre-trained Transformer
encoders for ALSC to extract an aspect-centric dependency tree that can locate
the opinion words. However, the induced opinion words only provide an intuitive
cue far below human-level interpretability. Besides, the pre-trained encoder
tends to internalize an aspect's intrinsic sentiment, causing sentiment bias
and thus affecting model performance. In this paper, we propose a span-based
anti-bias aspect representation learning framework. It first eliminates the
sentiment bias in the aspect embedding by adversarial learning against aspects'
prior sentiment. Then, it aligns the distilled opinion candidates with the
aspect by span-based dependency modeling to highlight the interpretable opinion
terms. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks,
with the capability of unsupervised opinion extraction.
