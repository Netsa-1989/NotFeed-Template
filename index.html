<span><p>Detecting online hate is a complex task, and low-performing detection models
have harmful consequences when used for sensitive applications such as content
moderation. Emoji-based hate is a key emerging challenge for online hate
detection. We present HatemojiCheck, a test suite of 3,930 short-form
statements that allows us to evaluate how detection models perform on hateful
language expressed with emoji. Using the test suite, we expose weaknesses in
existing hate detection models. To address these weaknesses, we create the
HatemojiTrain dataset using an innovative human-and-model-in-the-loop approach.
Models trained on these 5,912 adversarial examples perform substantially better
at detecting emoji-based hate, while retaining strong performance on text-only
hate. Both HatemojiCheck and HatemojiTrain are made publicly available.

<span><p>With the growth of social media, the spread of hate speech is also increasing
rapidly. Social media are widely used in many countries. Also Hate Speech is
spreading in these countries. This brings a need for multilingual Hate Speech
detection algorithms. Much research in this area is dedicated to English at the
moment. The HASOC track intends to provide a platform to develop and optimize
Hate Speech detection algorithms for Hindi, German and English. The dataset is
collected from a Twitter archive and pre-classified by a machine learning
system. HASOC has two sub-task for all three languages: task A is a binary
classification problem (Hate and Not Offensive) while task B is a fine-grained
classification problem for three classes (HATE) Hate speech, OFFENSIVE and
PROFANITY. Overall, 252 runs were submitted by 40 teams. The performance of the
best classification algorithms for task A are F1 measures of 0.51, 0.53 and
0.52 for English, Hindi, and German, respectively. For task B, the best
classification algorithms achieved F1 measures of 0.26, 0.33 and 0.29 for
English, Hindi, and German, respectively. This article presents the tasks and
the data development as well as the results. The best performing algorithms
were mainly variants of the transformer architecture BERT. However, also other

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a powerful approach
to enhance the effectiveness in information retrieval. Recently, with the rapid
advance of deep learning techniques, neural text generation has achieved
promising success in many natural language tasks. To leverage the strength of
text generation for information retrieval, in this article, we propose a novel
approach which effectively integrates text generation models into PRF-based
query expansion. In particular, our approach generates augmented query terms
via neural text generation models conditioned on both the initial query and
pseudo-relevance feedback. Moreover, in order to train the generative model, we
adopt the conditional generative adversarial nets (CGANs) and propose the
PRF-CGAN method in which both the generator and the discriminator are
conditioned on the pseudo-relevance feedback. We evaluate the performance of
our approach on information retrieval tasks using two benchmark datasets. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable performance or
outperforms traditional query expansion methods on both the retrieval and
reranking tasks.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06027">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, dense passage retrieval has become a mainstream approach to finding
relevant information in various natural language processing tasks. A number of
studies have been devoted to improving the widely adopted dual-encoder
architecture. However, most of the previous studies only consider query-centric
similarity relation when learning the dual-encoder retriever. In order to
capture more comprehensive similarity relations, we propose a novel approach
that leverages both query-centric and PAssage-centric sImilarity Relations
(called PAIR) for dense passage retrieval. To implement our approach, we make
three major technical contributions by introducing formal formulations of the
two kinds of similarity relations, generating high-quality pseudo labeled data

procedure that incorporates passage-centric similarity relation constraint.
Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous

<span><p>Reasoning on the knowledge graph (KG) aims to infer new facts from existing
ones. Methods based on the relational path in the literature have shown strong,
interpretable, and inductive reasoning ability. However, the paths are
naturally limited in capturing complex topology in KG. In this paper, we
introduce a novel relational structure, i.e., relational directed graph
(r-digraph), which is composed of overlapped relational paths, to capture the
KG's structural information. Since the digraph exhibits more complex structure
than paths, constructing and learning on the r-digraph are challenging. Here,
we propose a variant of graph neural network, i.e., RED-GNN, to address the
above challenges by learning the RElational Digraph with a variant of GNN.
Specifically, RED-GNN recursively encodes multiple r-digraphs with shared edges
and selects the strongly correlated edges through query-dependent attention
weights. We demonstrate the significant gains on reasoning both KG with unseen
entities and incompletion KG benchmarks by the r-digraph, the efficiency of
RED-GNN, and the interpretable dependencies learned on the r-digraph.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by evaluating on a closed corpus

prominent commercial invoice solutions that use discriminatively trained models

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06107">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the task of extracting triplets
of aspect terms, their associated sentiments, and the opinion terms that
provide evidence for the expressed sentiments. Previous approaches to ASTE
usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the
aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment
polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding
the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on
sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion
terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among
the triplet's components while improving exploration and sample efficiency.
Furthermore, this hierarchical RLsetup enables us to deal with multiple and
overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing
datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The implementation of this work is publicly

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06130">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The evaluation of question answering models compares ground-truth annotations
with model predictions. However, as of today, this comparison is mostly
lexical-based and therefore misses out on answers that have no lexical overlap
but are still semantically similar, thus treating correct answers as false.
This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along
with an implementation of the SAS metric and the experiments. We find that
semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much
better with human judgment than traditional lexical similarity metrics on our
two newly created datasets and one dataset from related work.

<span><p>Both latent semantic analysis (LSA) and correspondence analysis (CA) use a
singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction. In this
article, LSA and CA are compared from a theoretical point of view and applied
in both a toy example and an authorship attribution example. In text mining
interest goes out to the relationships among documents and terms: for example,
what terms are more often used in what documents. However, the LSA solution
displays a mix of marginal effects and these relationships. It appears that CA
has more attractive properties than LSA. One such property is that, in CA, the
effect of the margins is effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on the relationships among documents and terms. Three
mechanisms are distinguished to weight documents and terms, and a unifying
framework is proposed that includes these three mechanisms and includes both CA

anthem of the Netherlands, the application of the discussed methods is

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The advent of contextualised language models has brought gains in search
effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical
weighting models such as BM25, but also when used directly for passage indexing
and retrieval, a technique which is called dense retrieval. In the existing
literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements
than single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well
as for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.

<span><p>Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be
challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training

beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we
utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these

WikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing
crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating
question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset
poses two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and

content of long technical documents, deducing a relationship between these
documents, and expressing the details of that relationship in text. In addition
to the theoretical interest of this task, successful solutions can help improve
researcher efficiency in search and review. In this paper we establish a
dataset of 622K examples from 154K documents. We pretrain a large language
model to serve as the foundation for autoregressive approaches to the task. We
explore the impact of taking different views on the two documents, including
the use of dense representations extracted with scientific IE systems. We
provide extensive automatic and human evaluations which show the promise of
such models, but make clear challenges for future work.

<span><p>Question generation (QG) is a natural language generation task where a model
is trained to ask questions corresponding to some input text. Most recent
approaches frame QG as a sequence-to-sequence problem and rely on additional
features and mechanisms to increase performance; however, these often increase
model complexity, and can rely on auxiliary data unavailable in practical use.
A single Transformer-based unidirectional language model leveraging transfer
learning can be used to produce high quality questions while disposing of
additional task-specific complexity. Our QG model, finetuned from GPT-2 Small,
outperforms several paragraph-level QG baselines on the SQuAD dataset by 0.95
METEOR points. Human evaluators rated questions as easy to answer, relevant to
their context paragraph, and corresponding well to natural human speech. Also
introduced is a new set of baseline scores on the RACE dataset, which has not
previously been used for QG tasks. Further experimentation with varying model
capacities and datasets with non-identification type questions is recommended
in order to further verify the robustness of pretrained Transformer-based LMs
as question generators.

<span><p>Transformers represent the state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) in recent years, proving effective even in tasks done in low-resource
languages. While pretrained transformers for these languages can be made, it is
challenging to measure their true performance and capacity due to the lack of
hard benchmark datasets, as well as the difficulty and cost of producing them.
In this paper, we present three contributions: First, we propose a methodology
for automatically producing Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark datasets
for low-resource languages using published news articles. Through this, we
create and release NewsPH-NLI, the first sentence entailment benchmark dataset
in the low-resource Filipino language. Second, we produce new pretrained
transformers based on the ELECTRA technique to further alleviate the resource
scarcity in Filipino, benchmarking them on our dataset against other
commonly-used transfer learning techniques. Lastly, we perform analyses on
transfer learning techniques to shed light on their true performance when
operating in low-data domains through the use of degradation tests.

<span><p>Many COVID-19 patients developed prolonged symptoms after the infection,
including fatigue, delirium, and headache. The long-term health impact of these
conditions is still not clear. It is necessary to develop a way to follow up
with these patients for monitoring their health status to support timely
intervention and treatment. In the lack of sufficient human resources to follow
up with patients, we propose a novel smart chatbot solution backed with machine
learning to collect information (i.e., generating digital diary) in a

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00245">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Benefiting from large-scale pre-training, we have witnessed significant
performance boost on the popular Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Despite
rapid progress, it remains unclear whether these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
are robust when encountering examples in the wild. To study this, we introduce
Adversarial VQA, a new large-scale VQA benchmark, collected iteratively via an
adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Through this new benchmark,
we discover several interesting findings. (i) Surprisingly, we find that during
dataset collection, non-expert annotators can easily attack SOTA VQA models
successfully. (ii) Both large-scale pre-trained models and adversarial training
methods achieve far worse performance on the new benchmark than over standard
VQA v2 dataset, revealing the fragility of these models while demonstrating the
effectiveness of our adversarial dataset. (iii) When used for data
augmentation, our dataset can effectively boost model performance on other
robust VQA benchmarks. We hope our Adversarial VQA dataset can shed new light
on robustness study in the community and serve as a valuable benchmark for
future work.

<span><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have become increasingly more
complex and widespread. With recent developments in neural networks, a growing
concern is whether it is responsible to use these models. Concerns such as
safety and ethics can be partially addressed by providing explanations.
Furthermore, when models do fail, providing explanations is paramount for
accountability purposes. To this end, interpretability serves to provide these
explanations in terms that are understandable to humans. Central to what is
understandable is how explanations are communicated. Therefore, this survey
provides a categorization of how recent interpretability methods communicate
explanations and discusses the methods in depth. Furthermore, the survey
focuses on post-hoc methods, which provide explanations after a model is
learned and generally model-agnostic. A common concern for this class of
methods is whether they accurately reflect the model. Hence, how these post-hoc
methods are evaluated is discussed throughout the paper.

<span><p>Text generation from semantic graphs is traditionally performed with
deterministic methods, which generate a unique description given an input
graph. However, the generation problem admits a range of acceptable textual
outputs, exhibiting lexical, syntactic and semantic variation. To address this
disconnect, we present two main contributions. First, we propose a stochastic
graph-to-text model, incorporating a latent variable in an encoder-decoder
model, and its use in an ensemble. Second, to assess the diversity of the
generated sentences, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric which jointly
evaluates output diversity and quality in a multi-reference setting. We
evaluate the models on WebNLG datasets in English and Russian, and show an
ensemble of stochastic models produces diverse sets of generated sentences,
while retaining similar quality to state-of-the-art models.
